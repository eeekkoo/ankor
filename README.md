# Installing

## Mac
1. Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/sambarrowclough/ankor/releases) pages, and select ankor-{version}.dmg. 
2. Once downloaded, find the dmg file in your Downloads folder and double click to open up the installer.
3. Double tap ankor.app
4. Once Ankor is open, click on the "Login with Linear" button.
5. You will then be redirected to Linear's website where you will be asked to Authorize Ankor.
6. Once authorized, the Ankor app will open up with your issues.

## Windows
Currently there is no windows support. I have yet to do testing on a windows machine!

# Getting started
1. Once the app is authorized, you will be presented with a list of your tasks.
2. Click on the task row.
3. A modal will popout with an input.
4. Type in the duration of the task. We read time as human readable time formats such as "1h, 1 hour, 1h 10m, 10 mins, 10m".
